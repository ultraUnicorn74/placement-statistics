The Placement Statistics is an application for maintaining a student’s placement details in college. In this project we’ve tried to show the working of a placement cell and cover the basic functionality of a Placement Statistics. To develop a project for solving placement details applications of a student in college in order to nurture the needs of college placement cell record. The Placement Statistics is a project that provides a user-friendly, interactive Menu Driven Interface (MDI). All data is stored in files for persistence. The Placement Statistics System undertaken as a project is based on relevant technologies. The main aim of this project is to develop software for placement cell. This project has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly, which is not possible with the manual  systems, which are overcome by this software. This project is developed using c++ and file structures concept B+ tree.  Thus, above features of this project will save transaction time and therefore increase the efficiency of the system.
